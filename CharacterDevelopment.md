# Character Development #

_**"Bellator Stellarum"** - Warrior of the Stars_

In the attempt to try and keep this game more on the simplistic side of the amazingly complex Dungeons and Dragons style character development, there are relatively few character stats. All characters have no "magical" abilities which helps reduce the different stats coupled with not using the karma aspect or intelligence. This section covers those few stats that are both the base ones and the calculated usable stats for combat and leveling.

All characters are human and posses only normal human attributes. However, there are four major roles; **[Tanking](CharacterRoleTanking.md)**, **[DPS (Melee)](CharacterRoleDPSmelee.md)**, **[DPS (Ranged)](CharacterRoleDPSranged.md)** and **[Healer "Medic"](CharacterRoleMedic.md)**. Possibly adding a fifth role of a support, called a **[Technician](CharacterRoleTechnician.md)**.

## Basic Abilities: ##

  * **Rocket Jump** - Allows the player to jump and use their rocket pack to cover more distance and uses their energy. (Not for sustained fight however)
  * **Stomp** - Player takes advantage of the fact they are in heavy armor and stomps the ground stunning all enemies within 5 yards for 3 seconds.
  * **Power Shield** - The player Power Shield converts damage taken into their energy. Meaning for each point of damage taken their Power Shield absorbs a point of energy instead of effecting their health pool.
  * **Energy Tap** - Gives the player the ability to use their own energy and heal themselves for a small amount. (Not sure if this will stick around)

## Primary Stats: ##

  * **Stamina (STM)** -
  * **Vitality (VIT)** -
  * **Strength (STR)** -

## Secondary / Calculated Stats: ##

  * **Chance to Hit (toHit)** - The chance a character has to hit a target.
  * **Critical Chance (Crit)** - The chance a character has to critically hit a target.
  * **Block** - The block value relating to the amount of damage absorption a block does.
  * **Avoidance** - The chance to avoid taking damage from a target.
  * **Armor** - Calculated by summing up all of the equipped items, buffs and debuffs containing armor attributes.

## Character Ranks: ##

Character Ranks kind of act like levels with a maximum of Rank 10. However, Ranks are not levels; even past Rank 10 the player will still gain experience for quests and killing enemies with the exception that no more Primary Stat points are given and only points for Proficiency Skills can be spent. This system allows players to full max out their secondary skills with enough time invested.

Ranks:
  * **Colonel** - Rank 10
  * **Major** - Rank 9
  * **Captain** - Rank 8
  * **Field Marshal** - Rank 7
  * **Lieutenant** - Rank 6
  * **Sergeant** - Rank 5
  * **Specialist** - Rank 4
  * **Corporal** - Rank 3
  * **Private** - Rank 2
