# Medic #

The Medic class is the healer, essentially. They use a combination of abilities both close and at ranged in order to keep fellow players alive. At ranged the medic utilizes a dart gun, more or less, to shot steroids and other medical drugs at friendly targets. Medics are the only ones who can bring players back to life.
