# In Game Groups #

Like all MMORPG's this game will allow player to group up, provided they are of the same faction. The team size is given in the table:

| **Group Size** | **Name** | **Composition** | **Group Role(s)** |
|:---------------|:---------|:----------------|:------------------|
| 2 - 5          | fireteam | Tank, 2x DPS, Medic, Tech | any 5-man instance |
| 6 - 10         | squad    | 2x fireteams basically | small raids (10-man) |
| 11 - 15        | patrol   | anything        | mainly pvp groups |
| 16 - 20        | troop    | 4x fireteams basically |  large raids (20-man) |
| 21 - 50        | platoon  | anything        | any world events  |

Automatic group formation for 10-man groups will be made of 2x Tanks, 4x DPS, 2x Medics, and 2x Techs. Group names are used to insure that the group contains the right number of player in order to participate in whatever they are attempting.

Both Patrols and Platoons are group designations for PvP battlegrounds (war front or some other name). These are PvP instances of various sizes that fall into those two group sizes. The fronts are specific worlds that contain key resources that are fought over between the factions.
