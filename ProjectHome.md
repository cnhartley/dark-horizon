Never-the-less, man has explored most of the systems within our own galaxy and found many resources and developed several amazing new technologies. But...

The _{faction 1}_, founded by the large business conglomerate _{some business name}_ began on the far side of the galaxy from Earth and grew larger with people not being represented by the Intergalactic Government _{faction 2}_. Those two major groups war over the military strong holds throughout the systems and still cannot seem to find any common ground.
